# SLR Music Publishing and Education Repository

## Overview

The purpose of this repository is to centralize the comprehensive documentation necessary for all non-coding aspects of So Litty Records (SLR) and its affiliates, including JukeBoysNFTs and the Publishing Administration team (The Psyence Lab LLC). This resource bridges traditional music industry practices (publishing, licensing, royalty collection) with cutting-edge **blockchain standards** (CIP-60) and **Web3 education**.

The repository’s structure is designed to guide creators through the entire lifecycle of a musical asset, from initial creative output and file submission to global rights registration and monetization via NFTs.

## Current Core Document

The repository currently includes the foundational manual:

*   **1. Project Production Process Manual (2022 Publication Date):** This manual serves as a comprehensive guide establishing production best practices, clarifying roles (Artist, Songwriter, Lyricist), and defining the complexities of global rights management. It outlines the necessary steps for transforming a creative blueprint (**Musical Composition**) into a finished, commercially viable **Sound Recording**.

## Repository Content and Workflow Documentation

The subsequent documentation and resources in this repository formalize the collective’s workflows:

### I. Legal and Administrative Onboarding

This section contains the necessary documentation to formalize collaboration and protect Intellectual Property (IP):

*   **Artist Intake Form/Bios:** Required for all new artists and producers joining the label, gathering essential information like IPI numbers, PRO affiliations, and bios.
*   **Essential Contracts and Documents:** Mandatory documents required for membership and release, including the **SLR Code of Conduct**, **Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA)**, and the **SLR Publishing Contract**.
*   **IP Management Protocol:** Documentation reinforcing that all works, music, beats, and source code must be protected by the **NDA**. Members are strictly prohibited from **altering, deleting, or modifying any file** in the shared Google Drive or GitHub that they did not personally create or own.
*   **Internal Tracking Templates:** Includes the **SLR In-House Beat Discography Template** and **SLR Sync Licensing Opportunity Tracking Sheet**, used to track technical details, ISRC/ISWC codes, and ownership splits.

### II. Music Production and Submission Standards

This documentation ensures high fidelity and compliant submissions required for commercial release:

*   **Recording Standards:** The production process requires adherence to technical fidelity, with finalized tracks submitted in **lossless WAV format** (44.1kHz/16-bit minimum preferred). Cover art must be high-quality (**2,000 x 2,000 to 3,000 x 3,000 pixels** in JPEG or PNG format).
*   **Submission Workflow:** Outlines the artist workflow, including selecting a beat from the **"3. Beats and Instrumentals" folder**, submitting the final WAV and artwork to the individual artist sub-folder, and notifying the Publishing Team.
*   **Mixing and Mastering:** Documents the services available, including the use of **SoundCredit** (e.g., the SoundCredit SLR Playlist) as the preferred platform for securely passing work to the Publishing Partner (The Psyence Lab LLC) for mixing and mastering.
*   **AI Production and Prompt Engineering:** Encourages producers to utilize **AI music generators** and develop **"prompt smithing"** or **"prompt engineering"** skills for optimal outputs.

### III. CIP-60 and Metadata Standardization

This is the core technical standard for music asset registration on the Cardano blockchain, actively implemented by JukeBoysNFTs.

*   **CIP-60 v3 Rationale:** Explains that the **CIP-60 metadata standard** has achieved a **Technology Readiness Level (TRL) of 7-8**, confirming it is qualified for real-world application. It is designed to rectify P.R.O. data fragmentation by creating a comprehensive, **machine-readable asset registry** linked to the immutable public ledger.
*   **Core Metadata Requirements:** The standard mandates specific fields to ensure legal clarity:
    *   **Dual Copyright Delineation:** Distinguishes between the **Musical Work (Composition)** ("©") and the **Master Recording (Sound Recording)** ("℗") copyrights.
    *   **Universal Identifiers:** Requires industry-standard IDs like **ISRC** (for the sound recording) and **ISWC** (for the composition).
    *   **Precise Ownership Attribution:** Requires **explicit percentage ownership shares** for all contributors (authors) involved in the composition, which is fundamental for automating royalty splits via smart contracts.
    *   **AI Disclosure:** Includes fields to flag if the work is entirely or partially **AI-generated**.
*   **IP Management Protocols:** Requires the foundational administrative document, the **Split Sheet**, to be **completed and co-signed by all collaborating creators** prior to release, documenting the precise percentage attribution that informs the CIP-60 metadata.

### IV. Publishing Administration and Royalty Collection

The publishing function is executed by **The Psyence Lab LLC** (SLR's exclusive publishing administrator) and involves rigorous registration and tracking:

*   **Mandatory Registration:** All works are registered with key collecting societies to maximize revenue:
    *   **The Mechanical Licensing Collective (MLC):** Collects and distributes **U.S. digital audio mechanical royalties** from streaming services (Spotify, Apple Music).
    *   **Performance Rights Organizations (PROs):** Handles registration with organizations like **ASCAP and BMI** to collect **Performance Royalties** from radio airplay, live venues, and digital streaming.
    *   **SoundExchange:** Registers the **Sound Recording** to collect **Digital Performance Royalties** from non-interactive digital transmissions.
*   **ISRC Code Assignment:** If the artist does not provide an **ISRC code**, the **SLR Admin Team will assign one** to the track for digital tracking and sales purposes.
*   **Royalty Reinvestment:** A significant portion of royalties earned by SLR is **reinvested into marketing and advertising** to further the collective's reach.

### V. Education, Tools, and Partnership Resources

This repository is dedicated to housing the educational and open-source materials developed in collaboration with key partners:

*   **CIP-60 Tooling and Workshops:** Documents the **FREE CIP-60 Music Metadata Tooling and Education Workshops** co-hosted weekly on Thursdays with **ARP Radio/The Psyence Lab**. Developers and artists are encouraged to attend and use the **ARP Radio CIP-60 Minter Tool** to generate compliant metadata.
*   **Web3 Education and Onboarding:** Includes introductory resources such as the **Cardano Crash Course** and **Web3 Onboarding for Music Artists and Producers**.
*   **Decentralized Education Platform:** Features partnership documentation with **Gimbalabs** and the **Andamio Protocol**. Programs like **JukeBoys Music University** and **CIP-60 Workshops** are planned for integration with Andamio to allow members to earn on-chain credentials.
*   **AI/LLM Support:** References the **SLR Artist Development Agent AI** (accessible via a specialized link), which uses combined source materials to assist artists and producers with DAW troubleshooting, production questions, and generating marketing/promotional materials.
